		<p><b>ExtJS Beginners: Easy Steps to setup ExtJS workspace with multiple application</b></p>
		<p>Prerequisites:
			<ul>
				<li>Extjs SDK, library folder; if you dont have download 30 days trial version from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/evaluate/"><b>sencha website</b></a></li>
				<li>Extjs CMD, download from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/"><b>sencha website</b></a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><u>Steps: Open sencha CMD, and follow the steps</u> [By using "sencha generate workspace workspace_name"]</b>
			<ol>
				<li>G:\>sencha generate workspace myworkspace</li>
				<span>Now your workspace directory is created with name myworkspace inside G:\ folder, And you have to create application inside this workspace. Remember that this workspace does not have sencha library folder yet. And we will create that while creating the application.
				</span><br/><br/>
				<li>G:\>cd myworkspace</li>
				<span>Now we will create a app named "lms" inside myworkspace. By executing the below command it will automatically check the SDK directory "ext"; since we don't have ext directory it will automatically create the directory very first time and it will place the extjs library required files. [ message will start like "Workspace does not have framework ext at G:\myworkspace ... copying"] And then it will create app "lms".
				</span><br/><br/>
				<li>G:\myworkspace>sencha -sdk c:\ext-6.0.2 generate app lms G:\myworkspace\lms</li>
				<span>
				Now you are done with setup of workspace and app. If you wish to see the application execute the following command and open the browser to confirm. [localhost:1841/lms/].
				</span><br/><br/>
				<li>G:\myworkspace>sencha web start</li>
				<span>
				If you want to and another app inside workspace; you can simple add the following command and it will create the app:
				</span><br/><br/>
				<li>G:\myworkspace>sencha -sdk ext generate app qms g:\myworkspace\qms</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you can start adding applications and begin your work. !!!
